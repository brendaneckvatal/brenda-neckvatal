# Narcissistic Authority Games

## Definition

A behavioral pattern where an employee subtly tests or reframes leadership authority to gain influence without direct confrontation.

## Why It Matters

Unchecked authority testing erodes credibility, slows decisions, and shifts power dynamics away from structure and performance.

## Practical Meaning

Leaders should respond with calm containment, clarity, and consistent standards rather than engaging in ego-driven exchanges.
