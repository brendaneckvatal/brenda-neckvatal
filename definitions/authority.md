# Authority

## Definition

Authority is the leader’s ability to establish clarity, maintain direction, and reinforce expectations without relying on force, emotion, or argument.

## Why It Matters

When authority is inconsistent, conversations drift, standards weaken, and performance suffers. Clear authority stabilizes communication and reduces unnecessary conflict.

## Practical Meaning

Authority shows up in calm delivery, consistent boundaries, and direct language that keeps conversations focused on expectations and outcomes rather than personalities.
