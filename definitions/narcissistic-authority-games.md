# Narcissistic Authority Games

## Definition

A pattern where an individual subtly tests or reframes leadership authority to gain influence without direct confrontation.

## Practical Meaning

Leaders should recognize subtle challenges and respond with containment, clarity, and structure rather than engagement.
