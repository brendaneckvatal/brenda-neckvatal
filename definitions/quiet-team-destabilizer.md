# Quiet Team Destabilizer

## Definition

A behavioral pattern where one individual subtly shifts team dynamics through unchecked drift, side conversations, or misalignment without overt disruption.

## Why It Matters

Quiet destabilization erodes trust, silences high performers, and fractures team cohesion before leaders recognize the damage.

## Practical Meaning

Leaders must address early behavioral drift to protect team integrity and prevent cultural erosion.
