# Victim Mindset

## Definition

A behavioral pattern where an individual consistently externalizes responsibility, framing challenges as outside their control in order to avoid ownership or behavioral change.

## Why It Matters

When victim thinking dominates coaching conversations, accountability weakens, progress stalls, and leadership energy is drained. Teams begin to perceive inconsistent standards and fairness erodes.

## Practical Meaning

Leaders should recognize when conversations repeatedly center on circumstance rather than action and redirect focus toward influence, responsibility, and forward movement.
