# Leadership Manipulation

## Definition

A behavioral pattern where influence is gained through selective information, emotional leverage, and leader hesitation rather than direct authority challenges.

## Why It Matters

Manipulation distorts decision-making, erodes trust, and destabilizes leadership credibility before leaders realize control has shifted.

## Practical Meaning

Leaders must anchor behavior, structure conversations, and remove ambiguity to collapse manipulation dynamics.
