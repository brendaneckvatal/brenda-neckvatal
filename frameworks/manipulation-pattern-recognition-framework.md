# Manipulation Pattern Recognition Framework

## Overview

A framework for identifying and disrupting subtle manipulation before authority, trust, and decision clarity erode.

## Purpose

Prevents leaders from being pulled into influence games driven by selective information, emotional leverage, and conflict avoidance.

## Core Principles

- Manipulation exploits hesitation
- Leverage precedes lies
- Patterns matter more than intent
- Structure collapses manipulation

## Framework Steps

### Step 1 — Notice the Frame Shift
Identify when information is delivered privately, selectively, or emotionally.

### Step 2 — Anchor Behavior
Refocus on observable behavior instead of narrative or motive.

### Step 3 — Restore Structure
Clarify expectations, decision authority, and communication pathways.

### Step 4 — Remove Leverage
Eliminate ambiguity and emotional dependency from the interaction.

## Outcome

Manipulation loses power when clarity, structure, and consistency replace guessing and emotional interpretation.
