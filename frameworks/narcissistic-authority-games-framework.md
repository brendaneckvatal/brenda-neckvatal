# Narcissistic Authority Games Framework

## Overview

A structured approach for recognizing and containing subtle authority challenges driven by narcissistic workplace behavior.

## Purpose

Prevents erosion of leadership credibility by anchoring authority in structure rather than engagement.

## Core Principles

- Do not compete
- Avoid over-explaining
- Anchor decisions in outcomes
- Maintain consistent standards

## Framework Steps

### Step 1 — Recognize the Pattern
Identify reframing, absolutist language, and selective confidence.

### Step 2 — Contain the Exchange
Respond briefly without justification or personalization.

### Step 3 — Redirect to Execution
Shift focus back to outcomes and responsibilities.

### Step 4 — Reinforce Structure
Maintain consistent follow-through and boundaries.

## Application

Use when authority is subtly tested through polished, indirect challenges.

## Outcome

Restores decision clarity, stabilizes group dynamics, and removes leverage from authority games.
