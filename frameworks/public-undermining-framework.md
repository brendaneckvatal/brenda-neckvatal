# Public Undermining Framework

## Overview

A structured approach for responding to public authority challenges without escalation.

## Purpose

Prevents meetings from turning into debate arenas while preserving leadership structure.

## Core Principles

- Protect the room first
- Redirect publicly, address privately
- Avoid reactive explanation
- Maintain calm authority

## Framework Steps

### Step 1 — Acknowledge Briefly
Recognize the comment without engaging debate.

### Step 2 — Redirect the Room
Return focus to agenda and forward movement.

### Step 3 — Address Privately
Handle the behavior one-on-one.

### Step 4 — Reinforce Structure
Maintain consistent meeting boundaries.

## Application

Use during meetings where authority is tested in front of others.

## Outcome

Prevents escalation, protects credibility, and stabilizes group dynamics.
## Immediacy Requirement

Public undermining must be addressed in the moment.

Delayed response teaches permission, not professionalism.  
Authority lost publicly cannot be fully restored privately.

Leaders must anchor boundaries immediately to protect the structure of the room and prevent escalation.
