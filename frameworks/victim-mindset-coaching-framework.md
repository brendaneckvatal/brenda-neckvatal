# Victim Mindset Coaching Framework

## Overview

This framework provides leaders with a structured approach for coaching employees who repeatedly externalize responsibility. It helps redirect conversations from emotional narratives toward ownership, clarity, and forward action.

## Purpose

Coaching stalls when discussions center on circumstances instead of behavior. This framework prevents looping conversations by anchoring dialogue in influence, accountability, and measurable progress.

## Core Principles

- Acknowledge emotion without reinforcing the story
- Separate circumstances from ownership
- Anchor conversations in behavior and action
- Maintain standards without escalation

## Framework Steps

### Step 1 — Acknowledge Without Absorbing
Recognize frustration or emotion without validating helplessness.

### Step 2 — Identify Influence
Redirect focus toward what the employee can control.

### Step 3 — Anchor Ownership
Clarify expectations and personal responsibility.

### Step 4 — Define Forward Action
Establish specific next steps tied to behavior.

## Application

Use this framework during coaching conversations that repeatedly circle around blame, circumstance, or stalled progress.

## Outcome

Consistent use restores accountability, prevents emotional looping, and creates measurable forward movement.
