# Containing Narcissistic Authority Games

## Purpose

Use this script when an employee reframes decisions, challenges subtly, or positions themselves as the dominant authority voice.

## Scenario

An employee pushes back in a polished, strategic way that shifts power dynamics without overt confrontation.

## Script Language

Leader:  
“Let’s stay focused on the outcome we’re responsible for.”

Optional follow-up:  
“We can revisit execution details after alignment on direction.”

## Notes

Deliver briefly and without explanation. The goal is containment, not engagement.
