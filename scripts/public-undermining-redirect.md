# Redirecting Public Undermining

## Purpose

Use this script to redirect a public challenge without escalating or inviting debate.

## Scenario

An employee questions direction in a meeting in a way that tests authority.

## Script Language

Leader:  
“That’s something we can talk about after the meeting. For now, we’re moving forward with this direction.”

Optional follow-up:  
“Let’s stay focused so we can keep momentum.”

## Notes

Deliver calmly and briefly. The goal is to protect the structure of the room, not to win an argument.
