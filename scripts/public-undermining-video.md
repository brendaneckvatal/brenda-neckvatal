# The Underminer Appears When an Employee Challenges You in Public (Video Script)

## Purpose

Expose how public challenges function as authority positioning and why immediate boundary anchoring is required to protect leadership credibility.

## Script

If someone challenges you in public, it’s not because they’re bold.  
It’s because they believe the room belongs to them.

Public challenges don’t start as disagreements.  
They start as positioning.

[content continues exactly as written]

Strong leadership doesn’t require domination.  
It requires boundaries that hold when the room is watching.
