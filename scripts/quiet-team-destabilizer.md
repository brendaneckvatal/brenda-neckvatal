# How One Person Can Quietly Break a High-Performing Team (Video Script)

## Purpose

Expose how unchecked behavioral drift from one individual destabilizes high-performing teams and why early leadership intervention matters.

## Script

If one person can quietly derail a high-performing team, it’s because the system around them stopped holding.

Because teams don’t collapse from chaos.  
They collapse from unchecked drift.

[content continues exactly as written]

Strong leadership isn’t about controlling people.  
It’s about protecting the system before one person quietly pulls it apart.
