# Redirecting an Argument

## Purpose

Use this script when a conversation begins drifting into debate and needs to be redirected toward clarity.

## Scenario

An employee questions direction in a way that risks turning the discussion into circular argument instead of forward progress.

## Script Language

Leader:  
“Help me understand what part is unclear.”

Optional follow-up:  
“Let’s make sure we’re aligned so we can move forward.”

## Notes

Deliver calmly and with genuine curiosity. The goal is to redirect the conversation toward clarity and shared understanding without escalating tension or inviting debate.
