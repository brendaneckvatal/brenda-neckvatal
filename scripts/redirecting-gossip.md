# Redirecting Gossip Disguised as Concern

## Purpose

Use this script when an employee brings information about someone else without ownership or direct action.

## Scenario

An employee shares a concern about another team member while avoiding responsibility for addressing it.

## Script Language

Leader:  
“Have you talked to them about this yet?”

Optional follow-up:  
“If it needs to move forward, I want it coming with clarity and ownership.”

## Notes

Deliver neutrally. The goal is to redirect responsibility back to the source without shaming or escalating.
