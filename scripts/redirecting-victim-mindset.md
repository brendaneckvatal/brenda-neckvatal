# Redirecting Victim Mindset Coaching

## Purpose

Use this script when a coaching conversation begins looping around circumstances instead of ownership.

## Scenario

An employee repeatedly explains why progress is impossible, focusing on external factors rather than behavior or follow-through.

## Script Language

Leader:  
“I hear what’s making this frustrating. Help me understand what part of this you feel you can influence right now.”

Optional follow-up:  
“Let’s focus on what you can own moving forward so we’re making progress.”

## Notes

Deliver with calm curiosity, not confrontation. The goal is to acknowledge emotion while redirecting the conversation toward responsibility and forward action.
