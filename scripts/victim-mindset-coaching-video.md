# The Victim Mindset That Makes Coaching Impossible (Video Script)

## Purpose

Expose why coaching stalls when ownership is avoided and how leaders unknowingly reinforce victim dynamics.

## Script

If coaching keeps going nowhere, it’s not because you’re unclear.  
It’s because someone has learned how to avoid ownership without saying no.

The victim mindset doesn’t show up as weakness.  
It shows up as protection.

[content continues exactly as written]

Strong leadership isn’t about saving people from discomfort.  
It’s about teaching them how to carry responsibility.
